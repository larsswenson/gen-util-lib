# TypeScript Generic Utility Library

## Description

This TypeScript utility library provides a collection of generic functions for array and object manipulation, demonstrating the versatility and type safety of TypeScript generics. 
The library includes functions like an identity function, array reversal, object mapping, and array filtering.

## Installation

Before using the library, make sure you have Node.js and TypeScript installed on your system. You can install TypeScript globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

##Usage

After cloning the repository and navigating to the utilityLibrary directory, compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler:

```bash
tsc genericUtilityLibrary.ts
```

This will generate a genericUtilityLibrary.js file that you can use in your Node.js apps.

To test functionality of each utility function, run the compiled JavaScript file with Node.js:

```bash
node genericUtilityLibrary.js
```

This will execute the test cases written within the file and output the results to the terminal.
